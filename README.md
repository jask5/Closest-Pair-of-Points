# Closest-Pair-of-Points

Implementing the closest pair of points algorithm. For my output, I calculated the distance between the closest pair of points in every recursive call (including the overall solution) output to the console. 
Used the Euclidean distance between two points: sqrt((x1 – x2)2 + (y1 – y2)2)
